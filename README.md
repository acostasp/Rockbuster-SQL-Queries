# Rockbuster-SQL-Queries

## Project Overview
For this project, we were tasked with analyzing data provided to us by Rockbuster.

## Key Questions
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and   
they expec  data-driven answers that they can use for their 2006 company strategy. Here are   
the main questions theyâ€™d like to answer: 

1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic areas?

## Data and Tools
This repository contains SQL queries that analyze a dataset of all of Rockbusters' rentals from the summer of 2005. The data set can be found [here.](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)

PostgreSQL was used to enter the SQL queries used to analyze this data.

Tableau Public was used to create a story and add visualizations to the analysis. Follow [this link](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/RockbusterStealthDataAnalysis_17375818996410/Story1#1) to view the Tableau Workbook.
