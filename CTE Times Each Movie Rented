WITH inventory_count_cte AS
  (SELECT inventory_id, COUNT(inventory_id) AS times_inventory_rented 
  FROM rental
  GROUP BY inventory_id
  ORDER BY COUNT(inventory_id) DESC)
SELECT A.film_id, A.title, SUM(C.times_inventory_rented) AS total_times_rented
FROM film A
LEFT JOIN inventory B ON A.film_id = B.film_id
LEFT JOIN inventory_count_cte C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
GROUP BY A.film_id, A.title
ORDER BY total_times_rented DESC
